    <h2>Behavior-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        BDD is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between business people and technical people by:
        <br>

        Encouraging collaboration across roles to build shared understanding of the problem to be solved
        Working in rapid, small iterations to increase feedback and the flow of value. <br>
        Producing system documentation that is automatically checked against the system’s behaviour. <br>
        We do this by focusing collaborative work around concrete, real-world examples that illustrate how we want the system to behave.
        We use those examples to guide us from concept through to implementation, in a process of continuous collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2>Design-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions.
        It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application.
        This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Domain-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Domain-driven design is the idea of solving problems of the organization through code. Domain-driven design solves complex domain models, connecting to the core business concepts. It focuses on three principles:
        <br>
        The primary focus of the project is the core domain and domain logic. <br>
        Complex designs are based on models of the domain. <br>
        Collaboration between technical and domain experts is crucial to creating an application model that will solve particular domain problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Secure by design</h2>
    <p>
        Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design,
        and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers.
        <br>
        It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>Test-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
        In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Acceptance test-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) involves team members with different perspectives (customer, development, testing)
        collaborating to write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality. <br> The collaborative discussions that occur to generate the acceptance test is often referred to as the three amigos,
        representing the three perspectives of customer (what problem are we trying to solve?), development (how might we solve this problem?), and testing (what about…).
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Continuous test-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Specification by example</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of Specification by Example is to focus on development and delivery of prioritized, verifiable, business requirements.
        While the concept of Specification by Example in itself is relatively new, it is simply a rephrasing of existing practices. <br>
        It supports a very specific, concise vocabulary known as ubiquitous language that −
        Enables executable requirements.
        Is used by everyone in the team.
        Is created by a cross-functional team.
        Captures everyone's understanding. <br>
        Specification by Example can be used as a direct input into building Automated tests that reflect the business domain.
        Thus, the focus of Specification by Example is on building the right product and building the product right.
    </p>

    <h2>Data-driven development</h2>
    <p>
        Data-driven software development is based on solid metrics like Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives And Key Results (OKRs).
        Clear, objective, and unambiguous, these metrics encourage dev teams to think about the long-term strategic objectives of their day-to-day work and the business value of each project.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Data-oriented design</h2>
    <p>
        A data oriented design is a design in which the logic of the application is built up of data sets, instead of procedural algorithms.
        Data designs like this promote the usage of data to build the logic of the application.
        Its easier to manage especially in video games which might have thousands of logic paths based on animation or some other factor.
